            A hopeless alcoholic and troublemaker, Frank is usually shown passed out drunk on the floors around the
            house when he's not at the bar spending what little money the family has. Frank is careless, selfish and
            completely narcissistic as he hasn't done anything in his life but collect disability checks and get
            intoxicated.
            He is also abusive, conniving, being in Lip's and his own words, a "total f*cking asshole.
            " He provides next to nothing in the way of parenting or financial support and usually serves as one of
            the main headaches in the Gallagher household. Frank has also shown that he would give up his own children
            if it meant he could get booze (or money to get booze).

            Despite being easygoing, he has been shown to get very frustrated or fall into a rage at certain times. In
            these moments, he scares those around him and leaves them shaken. The best examples are when he attacked Ian
            for indirectly getting him beaten by Eddie, he threatened Fiona and V for trying to stop him from obtaining
            his settlement from Monica, when he expressed anger that shook Kev, V, and Svetlana after he remembered they
            were part of throwing him off a bridge.

            He intimidated his children into allowing him to have Liam after they kicked him out, when he attempted to
            burn down the homeless shelter for kicking him out and caused the homeless to flee from his actions, attack
            Monica.
